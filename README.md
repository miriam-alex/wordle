# Wordle
A terminal-based version of the game [Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/), written in Java. 

## What's Wordle?
Each wordle is a 5 letter word. After each guess, the color of the letters will change to show how close you are to the correct word.
If the letter turns green, it's in the word and in the correct spot. If it turns yellow, it's just in the word. Finally, if it turns white, it's not in the word at all.

## How to play
1. Clone the repository.
2. Locate the file in your command line.
3. Compile and run `wordleText.java`.
